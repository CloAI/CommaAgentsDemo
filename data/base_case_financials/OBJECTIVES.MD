# Overview
Talking with my friend Bryan, someone that works in accounting at a large publicly traded financial services company. In the discussions there were multiple pain points discussed in accounting. 

Primarily the nuances in the allocation and collection of the data. There are different formats, possible conflicts in transaction reports and cash journals. Although, the basis of these conflicts are able to be handled via niche routines, automation of these routines would be beneficial.

Secondarily there is the opportunity to have a system cross reference data and confirm the accuracy of the data. This would reduce overhead in the accounting department and maybe allow errors that were previously missed to be caught.

## Some Objectives Reduction
In the company Bryan works at the work is very atomic, in the sense a lot of different departments are responsible for almost line by line in reports. The approach was to bring this up to a larger scale and more broader appeal of a mom and pop manufacturing company. Allowing Comma Agents to better provide a general solution to the two objectives.

### Nuances in the allocation and collection of the data
- The system should be able to handle multiple formats of data
- The system should be able to handle conflicts in transaction reports and cash journals
- The system should be able to automate the routines that handle the nuances
- The system should be able to finalize these reports into a GAAP format, such as a balance sheet.

### Cross reference data and confirm the accuracy of the data
- The system should be able to cross reference data in various formats
- The system should be able to confirm the accuracy of the data

#### Notes from Call

Annoying things in accounting:
- More invoices, different names, kinda mess it up a little, same vendor tho (small changes, capitalization commas etc)
- Different department might have a separate ledger, or just a single number cash to vendor, so make this more department. Check from multiple angles to make it matches
